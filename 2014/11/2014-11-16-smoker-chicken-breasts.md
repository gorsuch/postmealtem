# 2014-11-16 Smoked Chicken on a Cold Night

## Timeline

* 20:00 Brooke applied a general McCormick's Chicken rub

* 21:15 filled evaporator bowl with water
* 21:15 started heat at max
* 21:35 temp got over 200 degrees, added chicken breasts
* 22:05 noted that temp was 250 degrees with plenty of smoke rising at the top
* 22:39 just under 300 degrees, believed I needed to add water but was mistaken
* 22:41 slightly concerned that at max power, we were still sitting at 300 degrees
* 23:30 tested chicken temp at ~170 degrees, tasted it, liked it
* 23:42 removed chicken, turned off smoker
* 00:29 family claims to like it

## Summary

It was cold, but I wanted to try this smoker out.  I seasoned it the night before in ~50 degree weather, and noted that at full power, the smoker got to nearly 600 degrees.  I was using the stock container for the wood chunks, which seemed a little flimsy.  I read elsewhere of trouble with it, so I replaced it with an 8 inch cast iron pot.

The timeline captures the general process.  Things turned out well and I look forward to the next one.

## Notes

* how do I make the degrees symbol in emacs?  I'm tired of typing 'degrees'
* was the cap of the max temperature due to the cold or the fact that I used a cast iron pot to house the wood chunks?
* some concern about the quality of the thermometer on the smoker
* general anxiety around running out of propane mid-smoke
* excited about the next thing
